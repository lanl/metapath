# metapath

Example R scripts related to predicting drug response in cancer cell lines using metapath analysis

We are currently in the process of selecting and documenting scripts for upload to this repository. Example dataset for using with these scripts will be available in the near future at modac.cancer.gov. When dataset is available, we will update this README.

These scripts were produced under U.S. Government contract 89233218CNA000001 for Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), which is operated by Triad National Security, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration. Funding was provided by the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health.

If software is modified to produce derivative works, such modified software should be clearly marked, so as not to confuse it with the version available from LANL.
